    "As optimization is quite computationally intensive, the optimization is ran on the DelftBlue supercomputer [(DelftBlue, n.d.)](https://doc.dhpc.tudelft.nl/delftblue/). However, there were problems with getting the MPIEvaluator to run and the queue was too long to claim an exlusive node for using the MultiprocessingEvaluator, so we came up with a workaround: running several SequentialEvaluators in parallel. That way, we could still do optimization with high nfe values. For each scenario, a seperate optimization process was set up, which ran the optimization for 3 seeds with 100000 nfe. This resulted in 5 seperate files, which were saved as Python lists with the Python pickle package. Below, they are combined to be one list. Next to that, the model is defined once again, which is necessary to use the EMA Workbench epsilon merge function. The code that ran on DelftBlue is included in a seperate .py file in the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is defined using our custom problem formulation. In the optimization, the expected annual damage, expected number of deaths and the dike investment costs are minimized for A2, next to the RfR Total Costs. This poses a dilemma: how can you ensure minimal damage and minimal deaths without it costing too much? As for the epsilon values, which indicate how big of a step the optimization algorithm considers as an improvement, we have chosen 1000 for every outcome except for deaths: this is due to the the other outcomees being costs with a high magnitude, while the deaths were always generally low when testing the optimization. Finally, all levers are included, as we want don't want to exclude any lever that could be of interest just yet."

Next to the candidate solutions, the optimization has output archives contained the epsilon progress per nfe for each optimization run. In this code, which is based on code on the course's GitHub repository [(Kwakkel, 2024)](https://github.com/quaquel/epa141A_open/blob/master/Week%205-6%20-%20robustness%20and%20direct%20search/assignment%2010%20-%20model%20answer.ipynb), the epsilon progress values are unpacked from the archives and plotted with a seperate color per scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the graph below, we can see that the epsilon progress for every scenario has stabilized, which means that the optimization reached a 'plateau' in its performance, so higher nfe values are not necessary for better solutions. There are slight differences between the scenarios though. It seems that scenario 2 converges slower than the other scenarios, and it seems that for this scenario, more stabilization may occur with a slightly higher nfe. However, the nfe value seems more than sufficient for every other scenario as indicated by the early convergence."

    "# Data Filtering for Final Candidate Solutions\n",
    "Now that the convergence has been evaluated, we can work towards a final list of candidate solutions: the selection of policies from which we choose the final recommendation(s). First, the different dataframes with solutions per seed for every dataframe are merged with the epsilon non-dominated function of the EMA Workbench, which uses the epsilon values used in the model to only keep the solutions which aren't dominated based on the pareto front. Then, these dataframes are once again merged using the same function. The outcome is one dataframe containing 88 solutions."

    "To further trim down the selection of candidate policies, the dataframe is sorted by expected number of deaths. As seen in the PRIM analysis, expected annual damage and expected number of deaths are closely related, so for now, the dataframe is sorted based on only number of deaths. As the waterboard cares about the limiting the consequences of climate change, and therefore floods, it is assumed that they mostly care about preventing damage and deaths, and care not so much about the economic factors (costs). The reason the costs were included in the optimization was that, otherwise, the optimization would go to extreme and unrealistic lengths to prevent any damage or deaths and there would be no dillema. Finally, we take the top 10 of the newly sorted dataframe and consider it the solution space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the newly created dataframe, it seems that policy 52 and policy 54 are promising, because they both have zero deaths and zero damage, furthermore, expected evacuation costs are zero and the RfR total costs are not the highest compared to other policies. A downside are the dike investment costs, which are on the higher side, but not exceptionally high compared to the other policies. These outcomes are only based on one scenario though, which is why the robustness still has to be calculated and taken into account for the final recommendation(s)."

    "The top 10 solutions with lowest deaths are considered the solution space for now. Below, the ranges of the lever values for the top 10 are plotted. Because with policy, specific policies are hard to implement, having insights in the ranges of lever values that lead to the best outcomes can be insightful. The plot makes for interesting conclusions. First of all, and to no surprise as it was the filter condition, every solution has RfR 2 and 3 turned on. We do see some differences in in which timestep RfR is introduced. For RfR 2, it seems that in most solutions it is introduced in timestep 0 or 2, as indicated by the higher mean of these timesteps. For RfR 3, however, timestep 1 seems to be the popular option. Unfortunately, in our problem formulation, the outcomes are aggregated over time so the model cannot provide specific insights in how outcomes change through timesteps. RfR 0 and 1 remain off in all policies, which means that they don't seem important in preventing floods at A2. Finally, RfR 4 is only introduced in some policies, which also indicates less importance for A2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, due to the low mean and max of EWS_DaysToThreat, it seems like warnings beforehand don't have much influence on outcomes, which could be due to potential false warnings being less effective. As for the dike increases, on average across all dikes, there is a dike increase of 2.7m, which is quite moderate, which is something that is preferred by the water board as dike increases lead to emissions and nature-based solutions are preferred to protect the quality of nature, which is further described in the Literature Review. However, there are large differences between the ranges of dike increases of different dikes. In all policies, A1 doesn't get an increase, which can be explained by the conclusion of the PRIM analysis. If A1 becomes too strong, the water force will increase at A2, potentially leading to a dike failure. As for the increase of dike ring A2 itself, an increase of around 3 meters is recommended, at timestep 0. Due to the small range of this variable across the different solutions, it can be considered important for the outcomes. The ranges of the other dike increase variables are high, indicating that the specific values that they take on are less critical to the outcomes and vary a lot across the candidate policies. "
